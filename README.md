# Overview

## Introduction
Our API simplifies how developers and businesses publish jobs into their software. PostAJob's API is a tool for web developers to build HR solutions. If you don't have easy access to development resources, we can recommend excellent third-party partners.

## How it works
Postajob is a simple concept - you submit your jobs description and properties into our API, and we dispatch it to the best channels. The API returns a bunch of useful data about the reach, clic estimation and application estimation. All channels available are visible here.
